## Getting Started

### Folder Structure
- `core` - this is where static data and function is stored, such as global services (Dio), theme config, [dart extension](https://dart.dev/language/extension-methods), and utils (image converter, image compressor, exception handler, etc)
- `features` - All the features in the program are placed here. Each feature has a folder structure consisting of domain, data, and presentation. The independent nature of the structure makes it easier for teams to change dependencies for a feature without having to affect other code
  - `[feature-name]/data` -  responsible for communicate with local and/or remote sources, using entities / models.
  - `[feature-name]/domain` - contains entities or stand-alone models, which are the basis for data types that bridge communication between `data` and `presentation`  
  - `[feature-name]/presentation` - Responsible for handling the user interface (UI) of the application. It contains all the code related to the visual representation of the app, such as widgets, viewModel (we used riverpod for this approach), and pages, or feature-to-feature communication like service.
